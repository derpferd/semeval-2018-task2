Task: Multilingual Emoji Prediction (English and Spanish)

For stage 2, we tried a number of strategies to improve upon our baseline results. The first approach was to use a character based bidirectional LSTM classifier as was done by Barber et al. [1]. Due to the slowness of testing the models, we were able to try two sets of parameters for the neural network and embedding size. A neural network size and embedding size of 128 seemed to work better than 64 so we used the former in experimenting. We wondered how a uni-directional character based LSTM and a word based LSTM will fare and so tried those too. We also tried a character based LSTM combined with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by dos Santos and Maira Gatti‚Äôs work on using CNN for sentiment analysis of short texts [2]. 

For the combined LSTM and CNN, we performed an additional experiment where, for training, we chose an equal number of tweets from each class. As we had a very dominant class (accounting for roughly 20% of tweets), we wondered whether this could be affecting the classifier performance since the performance of naive-Bayes classifiers, for instance, degrade when there is such a dominant class [3]. The change in using the combined CNN and LSTM on a dataset with equally represented classes compared to using it on the entire training set was negligible. We also combined the CNN with a bidirectional LSTM. Not too excited by the results of our neural network models, we tried a Bag of Words model with a Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) classifier. This turned out to provide the best results. The table below shows the Macro F1 scores of the various classifiers. Since we performed 10-fold cross-validation, we show the mean and standard deviation for each classifier‚Äôs results set. We add the results from our baseline - Bag of Words with Bernoulli naive-Bayes classifier - for comparison. En and Es stand for English and Spanish respectively.

```
			MEAN (En)	SDEV (En)	MEAN (Es)	SDEV (Es)
Word-LSTM		23.27		1.03		N/A		N/A
LSTM			27.83		0.47		N/A		N/A
Bi-LSTM			28.23		2.14		N/A		N/A
CNN + LSTM		29.30		0.36		N/A		N/A
CNN + LSTM (Fair)*	29.35		0.44		N/A		N/A
CNN + Bi-LSTM		29.29		0.36		16.15		0.49
LSVM			32.73		0.24		17.98		0.31
Baseline		29.10		0.20		16.49		0.42

* Fair means each class was equally represented in the training data.
LSTMs and CNNs were character based except for Word-LSTM.

Another experiment we performed, worth noting, was done to understand how much semantically similar classes such as camera and camera with flash impact misclassification. From our stage 1 results, we noticed that our model confused label 5 (smiling face with sunglasses) with label 1 (smiling face with heart eyes) significantly. We inferred that the model might have trouble discriminating between classes with similar semantics. That inference is supported by the fact that the model also struggles to discriminate between labels 10 (Camera) and 18 (Camera with flash). 

To measure the impact of these semantically similar classes on our model, we collapsed classes that were semantically similar and rerun the BOW model. The macro F1 score improved by 6 points suggesting that the semantic similarity between classes such as Camera and Camera with Flash does have an effect although the effect was not nearly as significant as we had expected. It is worth noting that after collapsing the semantically similar classes, a lot of tweets were misclassified as the most frequent class. Thus, it may be that the semantic similarity of the classes does really matter but the gain in performance from collapsing the classes was offset by the fact that we now had a class that was really huge and ate up too many classifications.

ANALYSIS OF LSVM RESULTS

Since the Bag of words model with LSVM classifier provided the best results, we present an analysis of its performance. The general idea of a Bag of words model for classification is determining how closely each word in the training data correlates with each class and then use that knowledge in determining what class to assign to any document based on the words in that document. Thus, if a document contains words that are more closely related to class A than any other class, then the document is classified as class A. Take the following tweets from our training data. 

```
‚ÄúI voted! @ Upper Tampa Bay Regional Public Library‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe Voted. #thebraunfamily #thisonesforyougrandpa‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúVOTED #NoMoneyTeam @ Tottenville, Staten Island‚Äù
‚ÄúI voted! God bless America ! @ Quail Hollow Golf & Country Club‚Äù
‚ÄúDoing my part today #ivoted #electionday # @ Richmond's First Baptist Church‚Äù
```

In our training data, all the above tweets (documents) were classified as having the American flag emoji. All these tweets (and many other tweets in this class) contain the word ‚Äúvoted‚Äù and, thus, ‚Äúvoted‚Äù shares a close relation with this class. While the word ‚Äúvoted‚Äù may appear in other classes, it likely doesn‚Äôt appear in those classes as frequently as it appears in this class. ‚ÄúVoted‚Äù in a tweet, therefore, is a strong suggestion that the tweet may belong to this class. By looking at all the words in each tweet, and which class each word strongly suggests, a sense of what class the tweet belongs to can be derived.

The job of the classifier then is to look at the training data and derive these associations between the words and classes and then use that knowledge to predict the class for new tweets. Of the classifiers we tried using the bag of words model, the classifier that performed best was the Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) classifier. LSVMs are by default binary classifiers. Each document to be classified is represented as a vector based on the features of the document. In our case, the features was the words making up the document (Bag of words). The document turned feature vector is then represented in some n-dimensional vector space where n is the dimensions of the feature vectors. Having represented these vectors, the Support Vector machine learns a hyperplane that separates the vectors based on the class. Ideally, you want all the vectors belonging to the first class to be, say, above the hyperplane and all the vectors belonging to the second class to be below the hyperplane. Each new document to be classified is represented in the vector space and the class it belongs to depends on whether it is below or above the plane. This is a simplification of how LSVMs work but sufficient to show that it can be used with a Bag of Words feature to classify documents into one of two classes. The LSVM binary classifier can be employed in different ways to perform a multi-classification and, in our case, we used LSVM for multi-classification.

The first column has the emoji labels (classes). Label numbers and their corresponding emojis are shown below. The last column shows the total number of tweets in the dataset that correctly belong to each class. Thus, 10,622 of the tweets correctly belong to label 0 and 5,077 tweets correctly belong to label 1. The columns in between the first and the last show how our model classified the tweets. For instance, for label 0, out of the 10,622 tweets belonging to that class, we labelled 8848 as belonging to label 0, 610 as belonging to label 1, 248 as belonging to label 2 and so on.

The first most important trend we observe is that labels 0, 1 and 2 perform pretty well in terms of true positives - ~83% for label 0 (8848/10622), ~57% for label 1 (2903/5077) and ~63% for label 2 (3171/5067) while at the same time being false positives for many classes. Take label 5 for instance. 327 tweets are correctly classified as belonging to label 5. However, 732 tweets that should have been classified as label 5 are misclassified as label 1. The trend of misclassifying more tweets as label 1 than are correctly classified can be seen in labels 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 19. Similarly, label 2 is incorrectly assigned to many tweets and the number of misclassified tweets often exceeds the number of tweets correctly classified. See the row for label 6 as an example. We suppose that the size of these three classes contribute to this phenomenon. Labels 1 and 2 are almost twice the size of the fourth most populous class while label 0 is about four times larger.

Below are some of the tweets that were either misclassified as 0, 1 or 2. The correct label that should have been assigned follows the tweet in parenthesis.

Similar to the confusion matrix for English, the first column has the emoji labels. Label numbers and their corresponding emojis are shown below. Note that label 19 is missing from the confusion matrix. This is because there was not a single tweet in the training data that had that emoji. The data in the other columns is exactly as described for the English.
